# What are Bollinger Bands?

Created in the early 80s and named after its developer (pictured above), Bollinger Bands represent a key technical trading tool for financial traders. Bollinger bands are plotted by two (2) standard deviations (a measure of volatility) away from the moving average of a price. Bollinger Bands allow traders to monitor and take advantage of shifts in price volatilities. Let’s examine the main components of this tool.

The main components of a Bollinger Bands are: 
+ Upper Band: The upper band is simply two standard deviations above the moving average of a stock’s price.
+ Middle Band: The middle band is simply the moving average of the stock’s price.
+ Lower Band: Two standard deviations below the moving average is the lower band.

According to John Bollinger’s official website, this tool primarily answers the question:

>Are prices high or low on a relative basis? By definition price is high at the upper band and price is low at the lower band. That bit of information is incredibly valuable. It is even more powerful if combined with other tools such as other indicators for confirmation.

Traders typically use this tool to spot trading opportunities through looking out for the contraction or expansion of these bands. Don’t worry if you don’t get the picture for now. You will notice these contractions/expansions when we start making the plots. Typically, traders use price movements below and above these bands as buy/sell signals. For example, a price movement above the upper band seemingly indicates an unjustifiably high price of a security and a trader could profit by shorting at this level and buying back when the price moves back in the band.

# The formula for a typical 20 day Bollinger Band

It is worthwhile mentioning that the number of days under consideration for the moving average is entirely up to the analyst. That being said, it is quite common to see 20/21 day moving averages in practice as there are usually 20/21 trading days in a month.
